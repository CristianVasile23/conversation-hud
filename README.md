# About

Have you ever had scenes with multiple NPCs talking to each other but do to your limited voice acting capabilities the players got confused on who is speaking?
Or do you simply wish to display the portrait of all the characters participating in a conversation?
If the answer is yes to any of those questions, then this might be the module for you.

ConversationHUD is a module that allows the GM to display a window containing portraits of all the NPCs that are participating in a conversation. Additionally, you can also show the players the currently active participant so as to inform them on who exactly is talking at any moment.

# Disclaimer

This module has been made to fit my needs as a GM during my sessions. As of this moment, I feel that the module is as feature complete as it could be, so I do not think I will be adding other functionalities unless I would feel that they would add great benefits to the module.

# Known Issues

If you encounter any issues, feel free to report them and I will look into them.

- There is a small issue caused by Monk's Enhanced Journal and the way it handles notes. If you have Monk's Enhanced Journal, you can only create a conversation note by starting a conversation using the menu and then saving it. This will then create a note that can be edited.
