# About

Have you ever had scenes with multiple NPCs talking to each other but due to your limited voice acting capabilities the players got confused on who is speaking?
Or do you simply wish to display the portrait of all the characters participating in a conversation?
If the answer is yes to any of those two questions, then this might be the module for you.

ConversationHUD is a module that allows the GM to display a window containing portraits of all the NPCs that are participating in a conversation.
Additionally, you can also show the players the currently active participant so as to inform them on who exactly is talking at any moment.
These conversations can then be saved, edited, and even embedded into other journal entries for quick access.

# Known Issues

If you encounter any issues, feel free to report them and I will look into them.

- There is a small issue caused by Monk's Enhanced Journal and the way it handles notes. Unlike the regular journal, if you have Monk's Enhanced Journal, you cannot change the type of the note after it's creation, which means a regular journal entry cannot be converted to a conversation entry. Since I do not know how to add the conversation entry in the list of document types provided by Monk's Enhanced Journal, the only way to create a conversation entry is by first starting a conversation and then saving it, at which point the entry will be created and it will function as intended.
